Ridaly's Marketing Agency is a Madrid-based company that specializes in marketing, design, and technology. They offer a wide range of services to help businesses of all sizes connect with their audience, including strategy development, marketing, technology, content creation, and design.

I developed the backend hosting site completely on my own (including the design) using the **T3 Stack** (Typescript, Nextjs & Tailwindcss). The site integrates with Stripe to handle transactions & caches subscription, payment and receipt information on a MySQL database to avoid saturating the Stripe API.

In addition, the website is fully i18n compatible and is already available in Spanish & English.

I am currently extending the platform with a custom Wix-style Website Builder that will allow their customers to visually edit and deploy static websites.
