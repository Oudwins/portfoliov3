# NOTES

## TODO

- Zog project + code block with Zod | Zog tabs
- Add click me svg for browser project (first one maybe only)

New header intro

- Fast paced environments/startups

Add experience section?

something to follow the cursor around (light)

Add a record & replay button to the header. So you can create a pattern then play it back




## TO FIX

- Ugly animation for website view on hover end
  - https://github.com/framer/motion/issues/910
- Maybe I can better implement the project image scrolling effect with a scrollbar rather than framer ?
