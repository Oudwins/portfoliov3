# NOTES

## TODO

Make some sort of sticky header or links on the side so we can go straight into contacting

Add social icons for linkedin & github

Add sitemap & more pages?

## TO FIX

- Ugly animation for website view on hover end
  - https://github.com/framer/motion/issues/910
- Better expanding, doesn't look amazing
  - Add animation between states
  - Add scroll blocking, or real full screen?
- Maybe I can better implement the project image scrolling effect with a scrollbar rather than framer ?
