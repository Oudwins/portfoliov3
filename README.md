# NOTES

## TO FIX

- Ugly animation for website view on hover end
  - https://github.com/framer/motion/issues/910

## To add

- Pop-over or hover card for more tecnologies
- project browser close, minimize & expand buttons
  - close & minimize will need a parent component that will nuke that project from the array
  - expand seems a little more complicated, not sure how I would do it
