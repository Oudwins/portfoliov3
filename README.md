# NOTES

## TODO

New header intro

- Fast paced environments/startups

Add experience section?

something to follow the cursor around (light)

## TO FIX

- Ugly animation for website view on hover end
  - https://github.com/framer/motion/issues/910
- Better expanding, doesn't look amazing
  - Add animation between states
  - Add scroll blocking, or real full screen?
- Maybe I can better implement the project image scrolling effect with a scrollbar rather than framer ?
